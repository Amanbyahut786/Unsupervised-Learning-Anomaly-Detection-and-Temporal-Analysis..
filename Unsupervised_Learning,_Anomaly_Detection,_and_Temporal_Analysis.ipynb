        "Ans.\n",
        "* Dimensionality Reduction is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the number of features (or dimensions) in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. It's like simplifying a complex map by removing unnecessary details, but keeping the key landmarks.\n",

        "Time series analysis can be effectively used for anomaly detection by leveraging the inherent temporal patterns, trends, and seasonality present in the data. Anomalies in time series data are often deviations from these expected patterns. Here's a breakdown of how it's done:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Establishing a 'Normal' Baseline:**\n",
        "   * **Modeling Normal Behavior:** The core idea is to first build a model that accurately describes the \"normal\" behavior of the time series. This model captures the typical trends, seasonalities, and random fluctuations.\n",
        "   * **Techniques:** This can involve statistical models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters), or more complex machine learning models trained on historical normal data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Identifying Deviations from the Baseline:**\n",
        "   * **Residual Analysis:** Once a model is built, it's used to forecast future values. The difference between the actual observed values and the forecasted values are called residuals or errors. Large residuals suggest a deviation from the expected pattern.\n",
        "   * **Prediction Intervals:** Instead of just a single forecast, many models can provide prediction intervals, which define a range within which future observations are expected to fall with a certain probability (e.g., 95%). Any data point falling outside this interval can be flagged as an anomaly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Considering Time-Specific Characteristics:**\n",
        "   * **Trend Changes:** Sudden, significant changes in the long-term direction of the data (upward or downward trend) can be anomalies.\n",
        "   * **Seasonality Breakdowns:** Deviations from the expected recurring patterns (e.g., unusually high sales on a typically low sales day, or a missing seasonal peak).\n",
        "   * **Level Shifts:** An abrupt and sustained change in the average value of the time series.\n",
        "   * **Outliers/Spikes:** Individual data points that are significantly higher or lower than their immediate neighbors, often representing sudden events.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Methods and Techniques:**\n",
        "   * **Statistical Process Control (Control Charts):** Traditional methods like Shewhart charts or CUSUM charts monitor time series data. When a data point falls outside predefined control limits, it signals a potential anomaly.\n",
        "   * **ARIMA-based Anomaly Detection:** An ARIMA model can predict future values. Anomalies are detected when actual values significantly deviate from the model's predictions, often using statistical tests on the residuals.\n",
        "   * **Spectral Analysis:** Can identify anomalies in the frequency domain, useful for detecting periodic anomalies or changes in underlying cycles.\n",
        "   * **Machine Learning Approaches (Supervised/Unsupervised):**\n",
        "     *   **Supervised:** If historical labeled anomaly data is available, classification algorithms can be trained to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns.\n",
        "     *   **Unsupervised:** More common in time series anomaly detection due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies. Techniques like Isolation Forests, One-Class SVMs, or Autoencoders can learn the 'normal' structure of the time series and identify points that don't conform.\n",
        "     *   **Deep Learning (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs):** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are particularly good at capturing sequential dependencies in time series data. They can learn complex normal patterns and then flag deviations from these learned patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Steps in Practice:**\n",
        "   1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Clean data, handle missing values, and ensure stationarity if required by the chosen model.\n",
        "   2.  **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features like rolling means, standard deviations, or Fourier transforms if needed.\n",
        "   3.  **Model Selection & Training:** Choose an appropriate time series model and train it on a segment of data assumed to be normal.\n",
        "   4.  **Anomaly Scoring:** Apply the model to new data to generate an anomaly score (e.g., residual magnitude, deviation from prediction interval).\n",
        "   5.  **Thresholding:** Define a threshold for anomaly scores to classify points as normal or anomalous. This often involves domain expertise or statistical methods.\n",
        "   6.  **Alerting & Investigation:** Flag detected anomalies for further investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, time series anomaly detection is about understanding the expected temporal behavior of data and then identifying instances where observed behavior significantly diverges from that expectation."
